Machine Learning & AI Project

This repository contains machine learning and AI projects developed using Python. It covers the complete workflow including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model building, training, and evaluation. Various algorithms such as Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest are implemented using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn. The goal of this project is to build accurate, efficient models and gain practical experience in real-world ML/AI applications.
